Chapter 0: Release Notes
</H3>
The files <TT>compid.h</TT> and <TT>dslib.h</TT> are designed to make all the
software in the portable by minimizing dependencies on
particular compilers. All example code in the book includes
<TT>dslib.h</TT>. <TT>dslib.h</TT> in turn includes
<TT>compid.h</TT>. The idea is that in order to add support
for a new compiler, you should edit the <TT>compid.h</TT> and
leave <TT>dslib.h</TT> alone. Typically, your compiler will
have one or more predefined variable that will uniquely
identify the compiler, and often the version number. <A HREF="compid.h">Take a
look at <TT>compid.h</TT></A> and you can see how it works.

<P>Right now, the following preprocessor variables are used by
<TT>dslib.h</TT>:
<UL>
<LI><TT>__MB_COMPILER_DEFINES_BOOL__</TT>: this should be set
if the compiler you are using implements <TT>bool</TT>,
<TT>true</TT>, and <TT>false</TT>; otherwise, <TT>dslib.h</TT>
will use an <TT>enum</TT> to fake it.
<LI><TT>__MB_SIMULATE_BORLAND_RANDOM__</TT>: set this for any
compiler that does not implement random numbers in the style
used by the Borland compilers.
</UL>

<P>Originally, I was going to support some of the older
compilers, such as Turbo C++ 3.0, using this mechanism, but it
made the header files very messy. Instead, take a look at <A
HREF="http://www.rowan.edu/evolve/Software/compnote.htm">
Notes on Specific Compilers</A> for
information on Turbo C++ 3.0 and other compilers that have
particular issues. In some cases, you will need to modify the
code by hand.
