<UL>
<LI><TT>cx4-1.cpp</TT> and <TT>cx4-2.cpp</TT> are not working
examples as presented, since there's no definition for the
Time ADT. Use <TT>cx4-6.cpp</TT> (along with <TT>cx4-5.h</TT>
and <TT>cx4-7.cpp</TT> or <TT>cx4-7a.cpp</TT>) if you want a working model.
<LI>The <I>readTime</I> member function defined in
<TT>cx4-7.cpp</TT> can go into an endless loop if you give 
it bad input, because the iostream buffer doesn't get
cleared. If you would prefer a more complicated but more
robust version, use <TT>cx4-7a.cpp</TT>, which includes code
for clearing the stream. (The same problem would occur if you
used <TT>cx4-3.cpp</TT> but it's not really designed to be
used as is so I didn't create a new version of it.)
<LI><TT>cx4-8.cpp</TT> may or may not compile for you without
modification, depending on how the C++ String Library is
implemented on your system; see <A

String Classes</A> for a discussion and workaround.
